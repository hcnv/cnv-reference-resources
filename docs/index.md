# hCNV Reference Resources
##### Data &amp; tools for hCNV analysis with a focus on the distributed normal

![XKCD Python library hell](img/xkcd-python_environment.png){: style="float: right; width: 350px; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px"}The site was started as a project of the [ELIXIR hCNV Community](https://cnvar.org)
at the [Biohackathon Europe 2023](https://biohackathon-europe.org):

**[A "batteries-included" open reference resource for human genomic copy number variants (CNV)](https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2023/tree/main/1)**

Main goals at the Biohackathon event were the identification of the best data
formats, how to deploy a tailored Beacon solution as well as the selection of
a data model for representing genomic variations and associated metadata.
